//Sass even has its own version of 'for' loop syntax called a '@for' directive!
//It works the same, but again, watch that syntax! 
//You can create a series of CSS rules that all follow a pattern 
//For this example, we create a series of font classes that increase by increments of 10px
//For the directive, 'to' means exclusive range and 'through' means inclusive range
