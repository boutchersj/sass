//This section is an introduction to Sass, specifically the SCSS syntax (the new syntax, file extension .scss)
//They won't really cover the Sass (or 'indented', aka the OLD one, file extension .sass) syntax here

//This challenge introduces the syntax for the Sass variable
//$text-color is a variable that is used to set other elements' 'color' properties to red in this example
//Gotta have that '$' for it to be a variable
