//Sass has an answer for problems that in Javascript would require the '.map()' method, and it's called the '@each' directive!
//This is a more explicit and simplified version of the '.map()' method that is like a '.forEach()' method actually
//You iterate over either a list or a map
//A list is like an array without brackets
//A map is like an object that uses parentheses instead of curly brackets
